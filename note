after create project we can push to github and in github we can add some team members

in the github under the your project click the "setting" and "collaborators"
 then its gonna ask the password and after you can add team with user name

 after you add your team if you work on project and if you wanna add new feature on it you should always create new branch and
 add all feature in the new branch then commit and push new feature when you on the branch, never push when you on the master.

 and when you update or pull something always make sure you are on the master.

 if you want u can also use intellij without going to the github when you push code and you can creat pull request and you can
 also merge from intellij or you can write comment so you can do same thing you do in github.
 after you push your branch then from intellij pres pull request then create new request from "+" then create
 then another team or you can merge or can approve or leave comment also.
