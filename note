after create project we can push to github and in github we can add some team members

in the github under the your project click the "setting" and "collaborators"
 then its gonna ask the password and after you can add team with user name

 after you add your team if you work on project and if you wanna add new feature on it you should always create new branch and
 add all feature in the new branch then commit and push new feature when you on the branch, never push when you on the master.

 and when you update or pull something always make sure you are on the master.
